# PageCage
Simple Chrome/Firefox extension to load a page inside an iframe, and thus protect it from other extensions

You can find it at these places:
Chrome: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/page-cage/ieboeloojjkpimfigcgijnkncjpabhbj
Firefox: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/page-cage/

Usage:
Install extension from the appropriate web store. An icon consisting of a cage with a little keyhole will appear on the top right of the browser.
When you click this icon, a new tab opens, containing a few butons and a text box. Type in the box the URL of the page to load, ending by Return, or by clicking the Load button.
After the page loads, you may hide the buttons and the text box by clicking the Hide button.

Bear in mind that many websites sill not serve the page if it is going to be loaded inside an iframe, which is what this extension does. In this case, the space below the buttons will remain blank.
